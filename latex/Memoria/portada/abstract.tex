\noindent Robotics ---discipline focused on the design, construction and programming of robots--- is made up of
various branches among which it is interesting to highlight educational robotics, characterized by
offer useful robots for learning, and
low-cost robotics, a field of study that seeks to overcome barriers
economics presented by traditional robots to ensure that everyone
can access this technology, both branches closely related to this project.

The robots commonly used in universities are really expensive, so
It is difficult to acquire a large quantity of them, limiting their availability. That is why
In this work, a solution for this problem has been developed. Specifically, it has developed
a low-cost industrial robotic arm that can be manufactured using any conventional 3D printer.

The 3D model has been developed with the FreeCAD 3D design tool, as it is open source. By
On the other hand, the hardware used is easily available over the Internet, which has allowed
develop the robot in an accessible and economical way.

The final robot has been integrated into ROS 2 Humble, a widely open source \textit{middleware}
used in robotic applications. This integration has provided an interface
standardized and efficient so that any application developed in this ecosystem can make use of it. Besides,
has been configured to be used in the \textit{framework} MoveIt 2, making it even easier to use.

With the combination of these tools and technologies, it has been possible to develop a highly efficient robot.
functional and resistant, prepared to be used in an academic environment training new generations. He
The result obtained represents a significant research and development effort, which opens the door to future
improvements and advances in the field of robotics.

Finally, numerous tests have been carried out that evaluate the different technical aspects that
They define the performance and characteristics of the final robot.
