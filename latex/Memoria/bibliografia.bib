  abstract = {This study aims at the parametric design, manufacturing and assembly of a low cost 6-axis 3D printed robotic arm, HydraX, which enables the combination of Additive and Subtractive Manufacturing processes on a single machine tool, through proper control and efficient movement programming. The robot was custom designed and manufactured by a domestic 3D printer with PETG, so as to serve both functional properties and aesthetics. 3D printing parameters were carefully chosen for adequate robot part stiffness and integrity. HydraX construction was complimented with proper off-the-shelf parts and motors for smooth operation. It has the ability to change its end-effector (milling spindle, 3D printing hot end, laser engraver, or gripper) via its specially designed Automatic Tool Change system, thus providing multiple manufacturing processes and part handling. HydraX has enough working volume to enable manufacturing of medium-size soft material parts and the stability to offer precision up to few tens of microns.}

  abstract = {This part of the study focuses on programming, control and calibration aspects of HydraX, a low cost 6-axis 3D printed robotic arm that performs both Additive and Subtractive Manufacturing. G-code was implemented as the programming language for HydraX, after proper process CAM modeling and code extraction. CAM software post-processor was developed as a Finite-State Machine (FSM), so that NC output files are automatically adjusted, when software input variable values change. Arduino Mega microcontroller has been connected in parallel to the motion controller board of HydraX for expansion of system functionality and enabling the hybrid manufacturing concept. Custom commands (M codes) have also been developed to establish the connection between CAM post-processor and Direct Numerical Control (DNC) software. With these additions, the automatic end effector changer controls the CNC milling spindle, hot end with temperature measurement, filament extrusion and cooling fan speed adjustment, thus leading to successful hybrid manufacturing processes.}

journal = {IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering},
abstract = {The arm robot with five degrees of freedom is commonly used for industrial or education. For Industrial uses, robot are used for the main step to make the production time more efficient and it can make a product with a good quality. Considering the benefits of arm robot with five degrees in industrial, the robot simulation is used to know the robot torque that will improve and optimizing the movement of the arm robot so the robot can help industry to produce in effective and efficient way. In this paper, the arm robot with five degrees of freedom will analyze the kinematic forward movement and inverse kinematic of the Robot simulation. Interactive simulation system is created using MATLAB software, which is one of the most widely used platforms for modeling and simulating robot systems. Finally, the simulation results verify the kinematic effectiveness in the robot movement and the robot torque according to the robot motion.}

abstract = {Since most of high school students in Jakarta love robots very much, they join Engineering Club at school. Unfortunately, only few high schools have a real robot arm for students to learn in their school labs. The purpose of this research is to create a small simulation program based on MATLAB® and Robotic Toolbox 9.10 which resembles Mitsubishi RV-M1 robotics arm. The simulation is a 3D view and 5 degree of freedom which its end-effectors position is as close as the real one. It is hoped the results of this research study can be used as a base for further development of human controlled robotics arms simulation.}

The environment can be used in virtual, augmented-reality and real-robot modes, enabling smooth transition from a virtual robot manipulator to a real one. We describe the main aspects of our platform that ensure low production costs and encourage openness of both its hardware and software. The main goal of our work was to create a viable low-cost robotic manipulator platform alternative for the university level courses in intelligent robotics, however, the application domain is very broad.",
