  abstract = {This study aims at the parametric design, manufacturing and assembly of a low cost 6-axis 3D printed robotic arm, HydraX, which enables the combination of Additive and Subtractive Manufacturing processes on a single machine tool, through proper control and efficient movement programming. The robot was custom designed and manufactured by a domestic 3D printer with PETG, so as to serve both functional properties and aesthetics. 3D printing parameters were carefully chosen for adequate robot part stiffness and integrity. HydraX construction was complimented with proper off-the-shelf parts and motors for smooth operation. It has the ability to change its end-effector (milling spindle, 3D printing hot end, laser engraver, or gripper) via its specially designed Automatic Tool Change system, thus providing multiple manufacturing processes and part handling. HydraX has enough working volume to enable manufacturing of medium-size soft material parts and the stability to offer precision up to few tens of microns.}

  abstract = {This part of the study focuses on programming, control and calibration aspects of HydraX, a low cost 6-axis 3D printed robotic arm that performs both Additive and Subtractive Manufacturing. G-code was implemented as the programming language for HydraX, after proper process CAM modeling and code extraction. CAM software post-processor was developed as a Finite-State Machine (FSM), so that NC output files are automatically adjusted, when software input variable values change. Arduino Mega microcontroller has been connected in parallel to the motion controller board of HydraX for expansion of system functionality and enabling the hybrid manufacturing concept. Custom commands (M codes) have also been developed to establish the connection between CAM post-processor and Direct Numerical Control (DNC) software. With these additions, the automatic end effector changer controls the CNC milling spindle, hot end with temperature measurement, filament extrusion and cooling fan speed adjustment, thus leading to successful hybrid manufacturing processes.}
